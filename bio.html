    <p>Kyle Mulqueen is an aspiring web developer based in Denver, CO. He is completely new to web development and coding, but
        is excited to see where this new journey will take him. His background is in music performance; he is a drummer.
        He graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver in 2017 with a BM in Jazz Performance with an emphasis
        in drum-set. Kyle's ability to improvise and adapt to new and unfamiliar situations will help him (hopefully) become
        a professional web developer.</p>
